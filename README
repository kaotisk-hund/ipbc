ipbc - Inter Planetary Bash Chat
--------------------------------

This program creates a chat system with IPFS backend to send and retrieve data.

You never actually send data, but people following your IPNS "chat" key will wait or
check if you published a new IPFS link over the same key. Of course you will be doing
the same to retrieve external messages.

## Setup
``` console
ipfs key gen my-ipbc-key
```

## "Post" message

``` console
post() {
	ipfs name publish --key=my-ipbc-key $( echo "{\"message\":\"$1\",\"previous\":\"$(ipfs key list -l | grep my-ipbc-key | awk '{print $1}')\"}" | ipfs add -q ) 
}
```
## Follow someone

``` console
follow(){
	echo "$1" >> ~/following-ipbc-keys
}
```

## Read their feeds

``` console
whatsup(){
	while IFS="" read -r p || [ -n "$p"]
	do
		ipfs cat /ipns/"$p" | json_pp
	done < ~/following-ipbc-keys
}
```
